The files are split as follows:

Task 1:
- StudentGradeTrackerV1
- StudentGradeTrackerV2
  I wrote 2 versions as I was unsure of what exactly the prompt wanted, the files are independant of each other

Task 2:
- BankAccount
- BankingApplication
  BankingApplication extends BankAcoount, they are NOT independant

Task 3:
- TravelItineraryPlanner

Task 4:
- HotelReservationSystem

I'm well aware I was only required to do 3 of the 4 tasks. I did all 4 because... why not?
